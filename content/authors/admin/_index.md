# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am passionate about researching coral reef microbial ecology and improving reef ecosystem management in human-impacted coastal seas. My graduate research will aim to discover coral innate immune mechanisms used to interact with endosymbiotic bacteria communities in Pocillopora damicornis, a widely distributed coral species.

- Marine microbial ecology and symbiosis
- Comparative immunology
- Coral reef conservation and marine ecosystem restoration
